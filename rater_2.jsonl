Since then he’s been enjoying his freedom, doing DIY, etc. I hear him tell people what a great time he’s having – which I should be pleased about as he used to work long hours – but it’s very different for me. I work from home in a job I hate. I have no office, so I work at the kitchen table or in the living room. I am constantly disturbed by him or our children. What doesn’t help is that I started my role last year and have slowly come to the realisation that it’s not right for me. However, now is not the time to start looking for other work. I find it really hard not to be resentful of my husband, while I struggle like this. I get up each morning and cry. I feel utterly miserable. I am talking to my HR department about reducing my hours, but with my husband on furloughed pay we have seen a reduction in our income. I’m not sure what else I can do. Weekends are ruined because I obsess about Monday, and taking days off seems wasted as it delays the inevitable start back at work.

However, recently at a wedding she got drunk and emotional and admitted that seeing her friends in relationships caused her a great deal of pain, and that she was still hurt over a married man she had fallen (unrequitedly) in love with a few years ago. I was ashamed for never realising this. She also said that although she realised how 'stupid' it was, she fell for any man who paid her attention or flirted with her, then got extremely upset when nothing came of it. She feels there is something about her that simply makes her 'not the sort of person people fall for'. And although she is fun-loving, easy to get along with and gorgeous, I did know what she meant. Because if it had been any other girlfriend crying in front of me, I'd have hugged them, held their hand and generally tried to comfort them. But because it was her, something stopped me and I was reduced to just awkwardly sitting with her. Is there a way I can help her break down these barriers around her?

I can’t tell anyone what I’ve read for fear of them disliking him.
