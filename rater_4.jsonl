{"id": 4151, "data": "Let's get physical The dilemmaMy best friend has never had a boyfriend, barely even a 'special someone'. Because she has many friends and a lively social life, I never thought this really bothered her. However, recently at a wedding she got drunk and emotional and admitted that seeing her friends in relationships caused her a great deal of pain, and that she was still hurt over a married man she had fallen (unrequitedly) in love with a few years ago. I was ashamed for never realising this. She also said that although she realised how 'stupid' it was, she fell for any man who paid her attention or flirted with her, then got extremely upset when nothing came of it. She feels there is something about her that simply makes her 'not the sort of person people fall for'. And although she is fun-loving, easy to get along with and gorgeous, I did know what she meant. Because if it had been any other girlfriend crying in front of me, I'd have hugged them, held their hand and generally tried to comfort them. But because it was her, something stopped me and I was reduced to just awkwardly sitting with her. Is there a way I can help her break down these barriers around her?

{"id": 4157, "data": "My husband is dead, so should I stop his monthly payment to his first wife? The dilemma When I met my husband, it was love at first sight. He was married, with an 18-year-old son, but left his wife soon after. Three years later we married and spent nearly 30 happy years together. During the last six years his health deteriorated, and he died two years ago. His first wife remained very bitter towards both of us, but more so to me. My husband and I did not have children, so I continued to work for almost 40 years without a break. Consequently, I now have a reasonable income. I own my home and, having recently reverted to working part-time, have an income, my pension and a small pension from my husband's employment. My husband's first wife lives in more straitened circumstances. He had maintained a monthly financial contribution to her which, according to a private agreement, ceased on his death. Should I continue to honour this? I don't know if this is a moral or ethical dilemma, or am I trying to assuage the guilt I still feel after all these years?
