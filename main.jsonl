During the last six years his health deteriorated, and he died two years ago. His first wife remained very bitter towards both of us, but more so to me. My husband and I did not have children, so I continued to work for almost 40 years without a break. Consequently, I now have a reasonable income. I own my home and, having recently reverted to working part-time, have an income, my pension and a small pension from my husband's employment. My husband's first wife lives in more straitened circumstances. He had maintained a monthly financial contribution to her which, according to a private agreement, ceased on his death.
